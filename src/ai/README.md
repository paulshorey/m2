This is not meant to be a clone of chat.openai.com or chatbotui.com,
but a completely new app with a better UI for **"prompt engineering"**.

**Greetings human!**  
The AI's response will be shown here. Prompts, settings, and responses will be remembered for later.  
:moreExpandable:<br />

**This is to help with "prompt engineering"**
Tweak and manage initial prompt and settings. Test with user prompts. Keep only the good presets.
You can even add intermediary prompt/response pairs to the history to teach the AI correct answers.<br />

**Built with uikit.ai**  
A React component library designed for building information-dense AI and search apps with great UX.
