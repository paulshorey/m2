### His dating app idea

  - How about focus on just meeting people in general, any people, any interests, like friends or colleagues.
    - An in-person events? With a companion app! That would be different.

### React Native

  - Easier than regular web app dev! I like it!
  - What do you think is the best way to consolidate one codebase (at least components, or even just styles) to be used in both web and native? Sure there's a solution already, react-native-web, but seems awkward.
  - I want to make very high quality UI components and experiences, and compile/publish them to both.

### Recruiter call

  - I was too eager, appologetic, desperate. I could have gotten higher pay? 
    - I didn't say anything like "I'm not a talented engineer" to her. LOL.
    - But I accidentally let it slip that my "contract" is over, instead of employment, which doesn't sound as good. I explained it well, but still.
    - She said the posted salary ranges are always exaggerated. People actually get in the middle.

### Technical "React" test

  - Should I be concerned about writing tests for the work? Test driven development? Test runner?
  - What do they look for? Who will be grading it?

## What you think is happening with Spiral?

  - They don't seem to be interested in publishing or promoting the documentation site to new potential clients, even though it looks great! They showed it to one client, but that's it?
  - Do you think they're pivoting to a new business model, realizing that simply a premium API will not make enough money to sustain an ambitious company like theirs?
